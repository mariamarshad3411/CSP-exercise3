# CSP-exercise3
This is my JavaScript exercise for the CSP class, where I practiced different JavaScript operators and user interaction methods. The task was to implement arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators, as well as collect user input.
## Files
- `index3.html`: Basic HTML structure for the assignment.
- `script3.js`: JavaScript file that performs the exercises and shows results in the console.
## Instructions
1. Open `index3.html` in your browser.
2. Check the browser's developer console for outputs.
3. Follow the instructions inside the `script3.js` to see the different operator examples.
## Setup
- Clone the repository or download the files to your computer.
- Open the `index3.html` in your preferred browser.
